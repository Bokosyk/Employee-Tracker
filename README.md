## Installation

Git clone the repo into your local computer and run using node.js using a terminal.

## Usage 

![]()

Step 1. Run node app.js in your terminal.

Step 2. The console will display a series of options for the user, prompting them to pick what they would like to do. Add or delete an employee from the database for example.

Step 3. The console will then run the user through a series of questions.

Step 4. The app will perform the action the user picked, storing or removing their newly inputted content from the database.
